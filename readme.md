## ✨ Problems Solved

Here is a list of the problems and algorithms you can find in this repository:

### **Array**

* **Maximum Sum Subarray**: A C++ program that finds the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. This file includes multiple approaches to solving the problem:
    * Brute Force
    * Prefix Sums
    * Divide and Conquer
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Kadane's Algorithm
* **Highest Product**: A C++ program that finds the contiguos subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest product.

### **Patterns**

A collection of C++ programs that print various patterns using loops.

* **Diamond**: Prints a diamond shape made of stars.
* **Diamond2**: Another variation of the diamond pattern.
* **Hollow Pyramid**: Prints a pyramid pattern with a hollow center.
* **Hollow Square**: Prints a square pattern with a hollow center.
* **Hour Glass**: Prints an hourglass pattern using stars.
* **Inverted Left Half Pyramid**: Prints an inverted left-aligned half pyramid pattern.
* **Inverted Pyramid**: Prints an inverted pyramid pattern.
* **Inverted Right Half Pyramid**: Prints an inverted right-aligned half pyramid pattern.
* **Left Half Pyramid**: Prints a left-aligned half pyramid pattern.
* **Pascal's Triangle**: Prints Pascal's triangle.
* **Pyramid**: Prints a pyramid pattern.
* **Rhombus**: Prints a rhombus pattern.
* **Right Half Pyramid**: Prints a right-aligned half pyramid pattern.

### **Recursion**

A set of C++ programs that solve problems using recursion.

* **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
* **Permutations**: Generates all permutations of a given string.
* **Recursive Digit Sum**: Calculates the sum of digits of a number recursively.
* **Subsets**: Prints all subsets of a given set (represented as a string).
* **Sum of Digits**: Calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
* **Sum of N Numbers**: Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers.

### **Chess**

* **Two Knights**: Calculates the number of ways to place two knights on a chessboard so that they do not attack each other.
* **Non Attacking Queens**: Calculates the number of ways to place two queens on a `n x n` chesboard so that they do not attack each other.

### **Other**

* **Angle Between Clock Hands**: Calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock.
* **Trailing Zeros**: Finds the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number.

## 🛠️ How to Use

To use these files, you will need a C++ compiler (like G++). You can compile and run any of the `.cpp` files from your terminal.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KavyaJP/competitive-programming-essentials.git
```

**2. Navigate to the directory:**

```bash
cd competitive-programming-essentials
```

**3. Compile and run a file:**

For example, to run the `TrailingZero.cpp` file:

```bash
g++ TrailingZero.cpp -o TrailingZero
./TrailingZero
```
